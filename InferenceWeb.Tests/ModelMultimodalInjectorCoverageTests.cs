/// <summary>
/// Structural guard for the multimodal hand-off.
///
/// The failure this exists for: a vision model whose encoder runs and whose prompt
/// grows by N image rows, but which is never handed the embeddings - so those rows keep
/// the embedding of the filler token and the model answers as if it never saw the
/// image. That is exactly what happened to Muse-Glimmer: <c>LoadProjectors</c> and its
/// prompt expansion were both wired up, but neither queue stage had a
/// <c>MuseGlimmerModel</c> case. Asked "这是什么图片" about a banner, the model replied
/// that it had been given "a huge block of characters, all 'o' repeated".
///
/// The injector used to route every stage through its own <c>switch (_model)</c> over
/// concrete model types, so a new model had to be added to FOUR of them and missing one
/// failed silently; this file used to scan the IL of those switches and compare their
/// coverage. Those switches are gone: loading and queueing now go through
/// <see cref="IVisionCapableModel"/> / <see cref="IAudioCapableModel"/>, which a model
/// implements once and cannot implement by halves. What remains to guard is the seam
/// between the capability interfaces themselves - a model that expands image
/// placeholders but forgot to declare that it can receive the embeddings would fail the
/// same silent way.
