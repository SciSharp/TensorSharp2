// Recycling of the managed (pure-C#) VAE's feature maps within one encode or decode.
//
// Why: a decoder feature map is hundreds of MB to several GB (288 channels at 2048x2048 is
// 4.8 GB), and each one lives for a single layer. Allocated fresh, the dead maps stayed
// committed until the GC got round to a gen-2 collection: a 1024x1024 decode peaked at 13.5 GB
// of working set where at most 2.3 GB of maps are ever live, and a 2048x2048 decode would not
// have fit in 32 GB. The drivers in QwenImage21Vae / VaeReferenceMath release every map the
// moment its last reader is done (Release), and Feature.Uninitialized rents from here, so a map
// is reused by the next layer that needs one of exactly that size (the decoder's map sizes
// repeat within and across stages). What cannot be reused is dropped and collected before the
// heap grows.
//
// Only the managed fast path rents (VaeReferenceMath.FastCpu); the device and scalar paths
// allocate as before, and Release is a no-op without an active pool. Every renter overwrites
// all of its buffer (Feature.Uninitialized contract), so recycling never changes a result:
// pooled and unpooled decodes are bit-identical (tested with released buffers poisoned).
